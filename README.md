# Abstract

The abstract should concisely describe your plans . Think about the complexity, the type of model you want to use, experiments or sims, forecast the major issues.

Example :

**We plan to study the design of an MPC controller for the XXX of YYY.

**The problem can be briefly summarized as follows:


**The advantages of the proposed design compared to existing literature are ......

**We will follow the work in [] and apply use the model in []. We will test the design in simulations (experiments)
in the following scenario(s): (perfect model knowledge, model mismatch, full state available, output feedback, no noise, with noise,...)

**If all works as expected we will observe....

**As last step we plan to extend the work to ....
